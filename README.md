# Introduction

This is a simple application that aims to connect Ethereum wallets, such as **_Metamask_**, and retrieve cryptocurrency ticker data from **_CoinGecko_**.

The application follows the specifications below:

1. Uses the React.js front-end library. However, I opted for the Next.js framework to facilitate easy and quick deployment on Vercel.
2. There is a "Connect Wallet" button. When clicked, the application will detect the installed Metamask wallet or Ethereum wallet.
3. After successfully connecting the wallet, we can view our wallet address and balance.
4. There is cryptocurrency ticker data displayed in a running text format.
